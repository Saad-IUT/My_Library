# My Library
NodeJS based library system (see it LIVE [here](https://library-un.herokuapp.com/))

## Note
I created this repository for practical implementation of a **NodeJS app on Heroku** from scratch to get a better grip of the topic. I followed **MVC** pattern here. Please don't consider to use it for production environment. You can learn from the source code by exploring.
